;; This code was worked out in a group to start solving a small
;; portion of a Viennese maze, specifically the 4 top left nodes (a, b, e, f)
;; of the square maze at https://i.imgur.com/j2gWurM.jpg
;;
;; The code below can get the bicyclist home... ignoring important constraints.
;; It lacks error handling, name spacing, and pull requests to add all that.

;; it's a map! it's a function!
